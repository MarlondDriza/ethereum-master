## [1.0.0-3.0.3] - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ sry :(


## [4.0.0] - 2019-06-22
-- No need to convert from Call to Send, as the latter was removed. TxSentry will accept `Call` now.
-- You can now track the latest block number if you're running an EventSentry.
-- Bytes decoders in Abi.Decode now return Hex instead of String
-- staticBytes encoder no longer returns Result, until new "safer" API is fully fleshed out
-- Updated version of bigint library
-- Encoder.functionCall now takes the 4-byte hashed function signature (ABI formatted). Elm no longer needs to do the costly Keccak work.
-- Changed Abi module to Eth.Abi
-- Replaced all uses of Eth.Types.Call with Eth.Sentry.Tx.Send extensible type alias
-- Expose new Eth.Utils functions
